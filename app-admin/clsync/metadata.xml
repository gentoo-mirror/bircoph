<longdescription>
  Clsync recursively watches for source directory and executes external
  program to sync the changes. Clsync is adapted to be used together with rsync.
  This utility is much more lightweight than competitors and supports such
  features as separate queue for big files, regex file filter, multi-threading
  and multicast notifing clsync instances on another nodes to prevent loop
  syncing.
