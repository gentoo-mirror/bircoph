  Old and good ffmpeg repository is dead now...

  I tend to use libav fork of ffmpeg as git repository, but for now
  it doesn't even compile. And I'm not really sure which form to
  choose: on the one hand, it looks like libav will get better
  support from mplayer developers; on the other hand ffmpeg repo
  looks like more active. Of course, anyone is free to select
  between ffmpeg and libav git repositories. Maybe USE flag should
  be used for this selection?

  Really, I have all this bikeshed, people should work together,
  not play in holy wars.

  Fix installation for realcodecs docs and EAPI=4.

*mplayer-9999 (18 Oct 2010)

  18 Oct 2010; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gmail.com> +mplayer-9999.ebuild:
  Initial ebuild.
  This ebuild is intended to be close with portage one, providing
  (at this moment) the following additional features:
    - support for tivo (vstream-client);
    - support for nemesi (libnemesi live ebuild now works fine);
    - use real binary codecs (in very rare cases when open codecs fail
      they may be usefull);
    - restore support for svga video output and svga kernel helper.
