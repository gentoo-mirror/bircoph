*mplayer-9999 (18 Oct 2010)

  18 Oct 2010; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gmail.com> +mplayer-9999.ebuild:
  Initial ebuild.
  This ebuild is intended to be close with portage one, providing
  (at this moment) the following additional features:
    - support for tivo (vstream-client);
    - support for nemesi (libnemesi live ebuild now works fine);
    - use real binary codecs (in very rare cases when open codecs fail
      they may be usefull);
    - restore support for svga video output and svga kernel helper.
