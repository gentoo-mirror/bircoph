  02 Aug 2011; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gmail.com> mplayer-9999.ebuild,
  ChangeLog.portage:
  Replace deprecated hasq by has.

  06 Jun 2011; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gmail.com> mplayer-9999.ebuild:
  Sync with portage ebuild, but do not unbundle ffmpeg due to both
  performance and stability reasons. Deselect libav as default.

  19 May 2011; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gmail.com> mplayer-9999.ebuild:
  Make selection between bundled libav and ffmpeg switchable via
  libav use flag. Left libav as default

  27 Mar 2011; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gmail.com> mplayer-9999.ebuild:
  Use libav as main ffmpeg fork.
  Sync with upstream, but do not revert REQURIDE_USE for now (no
  good reason for this).

  Old and good ffmpeg repository is dead now...

  I tend to use libav fork of ffmpeg as git repository, but for now
  it doesn't even compile. And I'm not really sure which form to
  choose: on the one hand, it looks like libav will get better
  support from mplayer developers; on the other hand ffmpeg repo
  looks like more active. Of course, anyone is free to select
  between ffmpeg and libav git repositories. Maybe USE flag should
  be used for this selection?

  Really, I have all this bikeshed, people should work together,
  not play in holy wars.

  Fix installation for realcodecs docs and EAPI=4.

*mplayer-9999 (18 Oct 2010)

  18 Oct 2010; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gmail.com> +mplayer-9999.ebuild:
  Initial ebuild.
  This ebuild is intended to be close with portage one, providing
  (at this moment) the following additional features:
    - support for tivo (vstream-client);
    - support for nemesi (libnemesi live ebuild now works fine);
    - use real binary codecs (in very rare cases when open codecs fail
      they may be usefull);
    - restore support for svga video output and svga kernel helper.
